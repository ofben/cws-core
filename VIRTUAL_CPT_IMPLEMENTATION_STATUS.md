## üîÑ Current Status

**Branch:** `feature/virtual-cpt-implementation`
**GitHub:** https://github.com/ofben/cws-core/tree/feature/virtual-cpt-implementation

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Activate the Plugin
1. Go to WordPress Admin ‚Üí Plugins
2. Activate CWS Core plugin
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí CWS Core
4. Configure your API settings (endpoint, organization ID)
5. Add job IDs in the "Job IDs" field (e.g., `22026695, 22026696`)

### Step 2: Run the Test File
1. Copy `test-virtual-cpt.php` to your WordPress root directory
2. Visit `https://yoursite.com/test-virtual-cpt.php`
3. Verify all tests pass (green checkmarks)
4. **Delete the test file after testing**

### Step 3: Test Job Pages
1. Visit `https://yoursite.com/job/22026695/`
2. Check if the page loads without 404 errors
3. Verify job data is displayed

### Step 4: Test EtchWP Integration
1. Go to EtchWP Templates
2. Create a new template for `cws_job` post type
3. Add dynamic content using:
   - `{this.title}` for job title
   - `{this.meta.cws_job_company}` for company
   - `{this.meta.cws_job_location}` for location
   - `{this.content}` for job description

## üìã Next Steps (Future Phases)

### Phase 6: Dynamic Job Discovery
- [ ] Create `CWS_Core_Job_Discovery` class
- [ ] Implement API pagination for job lists
- [ ] Add background sync functionality
- [ ] Create admin interface for job management

### Phase 7: Advanced Features
- [ ] Job status filtering (active/inactive)
- [ ] Category-based filtering
- [ ] Search functionality
- [ ] Pagination support

### Phase 8: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement advanced caching strategies
- [ ] Add cache warming for popular jobs
- [ ] Optimize API request patterns

## üêõ Known Issues

1. **Rewrite Rules**: May need to flush rewrite rules after activation
2. **Template Loading**: EtchWP templates need to be created manually
3. **Error Handling**: Some edge cases may need additional error handling

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If job pages return 404:
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí CWS Core
2. Click "Flush Rewrite Rules" button
3. Try accessing the job page again

### If virtual posts don't load:
1. Check WordPress debug log for errors
2. Verify API connection in CWS Core settings
3. Ensure job IDs are configured correctly

### If EtchWP doesn't recognize posts:
1. Verify `cws_job` post type is registered
2. Check that virtual post meta is accessible
3. Test with simple queries first
